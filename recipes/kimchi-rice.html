        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This easy Kimchi Fried Rice recipe was a staple in my house growing up and still is today! It's a delicious meal on its own, 
            especially topped with a fried egg, but can also 
            be served as a side dish for other Korean dishes like bulgogi or spicy grilled pork belly.</p>
